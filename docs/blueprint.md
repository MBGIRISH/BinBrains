# **App Name**: BinBrain

## Core Features:

- Dustbin Simulation: Simulate a virtual representation of smart dustbins, mimicking real-world sensor data. This involves the integration of data from ultrasonic, ESP, and IP sensors to determine fill levels, and send messages when they are full.
- Simulated fill-level alerts: Simulate real time alerts (the pop-up messages). Configure threshold level, when level is passed, create pop up to the screen
- Smart waste management suggestions: Employ a tool that generates waste management tips for the user. It leverages the specific real-time waste status obtained from dustbin sensors. Depending on fill-level, time since last emptied, weather conditions, the LLM is to create region and time relevant waste management strategies and practices.
- Visual guide on waste sorting: Present waste separation methods visually

## Style Guidelines:

- A clean, modern palette with white or light gray backgrounds.
- Use Green (#4CAF50) to communicate that a dustbin is ok. Red (#F44336) can be used to communicate errors and overfilled bins. 
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and primary calls to action.
- Clean and modern typography, with clear hierarchy for readability.
- Simple, clear, and recognizable icons to represent different types of waste.
- Clean layout with well-defined sections, making information easily accessible.
- Subtle transitions for a smooth user experience, especially for loading sensor data and displaying alerts.
